There is, actually, a very important thing I should note before starting to publish anything here on this blog: I love JavaScript and I'll probably be biased for it.
Not a big deal if you think that you actually don't have to read anything I write.

On the other hand, "loving JavaScript" also means, in some way, loving Node.js (I know you people hate these kind of conclusive statements but, I can't help myself.)
Which is cool, because Node.js is cool and it gives us, the JavaScript programmers, the ability to come up with great server-side stuff and create awesome tools that
work on various platforms.

So, what about someone offering me a topic to discuss on Node.js? If I can find some time to share the knowledge I gained while developing stuff with Node.js, I'd
make sure that some need *that* information.
